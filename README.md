This is a project Developed in my 7th Semester in University, for the Class named 
"Database Technologies", this was a project that asked of us to create an application using JavaSwing
or JavaFx for the UI and connect to either an Oracle or PostgreSQL 
Relation Database of Minimum 5 Tables with Primary and Foreign keys.
The Application needed to meet a certain standard and afterwards you
could go as far beyond as you wished, the standards were a minimum of 5
tables in a relational model, 1 or more log file tables, 10 Prepared Statements
with parameters called at runtime, INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE functions through the ui.
